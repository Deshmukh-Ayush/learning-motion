# Learning Motion

Welcome to **Learning Motion**, a public repository where I share my journey of building and experimenting with various UI components, animations, and motion designs. This repo serves as a sandbox for learning and showcasing reusable components as I develop them.

## About the Project

This repository is a collection of components, animations, and motion-based experiments that I create while learning and exploring front-end development. Each component is designed to be reusable, well-documented, and focused on delivering smooth, engaging user experiences. The goal is to experiment with modern web technologies, particularly those related to animations and motion design, and share the results with the community.

## Features

- **Reusable Components**: Modular and customizable UI components with a focus on animations and motion.
- **Learning in Public**: Follow along as I build, test, and refine components with detailed explanations.
- **Open Source**: Feel free to use, modify, or contribute to any component in this repo.
- **Well-Documented**: Each component includes usage instructions, code examples, and notes on the implementation.

## Getting Started

To explore or use the components in this repository, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher recommended)
- A package manager like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Familiarity with frameworks like React, Vue, or similar (depending on the component)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/learning-motion.git
   cd learning-motion
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the project or component:
   - Navigate to the specific component folder (e.g., `/components/button-animation`).
   - Follow the component-specific README for setup and usage instructions.

## Usage

Each component folder contains its own README with detailed instructions on how to use it. Here's a general example of how to use a component:

1. Navigate to the component folder:
   ```bash
   cd components/button-animation
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the component:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Import and use the component in your project (example for a React component):
   ```javascript
   import MotionButton from './components/button-animation';

   function App() {
     return <MotionButton label="Click Me" />;
   }
   ```

Check the specific component's README for detailed usage instructions and customization options.
